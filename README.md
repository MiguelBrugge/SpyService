# SpyService
This is the SpyService website I made for Front-End Development. The coding languages I used are HTML, CSS and PHP for this project.

### Login Page

On the Document page you can see you need to login to be able to see the secret documents.

I have hashed the password using php in the code. You will not be able to see the secret documents without knowing the password because the password is hashed. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103996305/164533532-903eb52d-c2d7-472c-ae30-29608eba012f.png)

The hashing is done using the password_hash() function from php. After you have hashed the password and copied the hash you van verify the hash and compare it to the user input.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103996305/164534097-a9652b6b-2638-4863-88ad-6a714a5aca8c.png)
